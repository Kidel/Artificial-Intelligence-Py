# Artificial Intelligence Py
Artificial Intelligence experiments using **Python** in **Jupyter Notebook**.

#### Why do I need it?
This is meant to be just code kata. Don't use it, there are more optimized libraries (expecially for neural networks, see [here](https://github.com/Kidel/Deep-Learning-CNN-for-Image-Recognition)).


## Implemented algorithms
* Neural Network training (1 hidden layer)
* Simulated Annealing
* Genetic Algorithm

#### Special thanks and credits
Base for pseudo code and many ideas are directly derived from my course book,
*"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Third edition) by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig"*.
That book is simply amazing.

A huge part of neural networks pseudo code, Python instructions and suggestions are from [Stephen](https://github.com/stephencwelch) and his video lessons.
