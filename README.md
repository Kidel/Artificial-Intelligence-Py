# Artificial-Intelligence-Py
Artificial Intelligence experiments using Python and Jupyter.

#### Why do I need it?
You really don't :ghost:. There are a lot of libraries for machine learning out there that are way better then this one. This is meant to be just an experiment or simply practice.


## Implemented algorithms
* Neural Network training (1 hidden layer)
* Simulated Annealing
* Genetic Algorithm

***

## Installation
Just install [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) or [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), run the notebook and browse to the files.

#### Special thanks and credits
Base for pseudo code and many ideas are directly derived from my course book,
*"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Third edition) by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig"*.
That book is simply amazing.

A huge part of neural networks pseudo code, Python instructions and suggestions are from [Stephen](https://github.com/stephencwelch) and his video lessons.
